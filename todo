 - the momentum + risk parity seems too good to be true...
 	 - although... i am selecting by momentum FIRST. so high flying etfs like EEM will be selected. then i'm toning down my exposure to them based on volatility...
 	 	- so during 2007, when equities were faltering, i stopped selecting them. even before that though, i was reducing my exposure due to volatility
 	 - should i step through it, make sure there isn't any lookahead bias? esp. during times of supposed economic volatility...
 	 - what about trying to replicate the returns, by building it off mom_backtest (instead of vol_backtest)
 	 	- honestly, since i will just be copy pasting code, this should be exactly the same...
 	 - OH SHIT... the momentum and volatility metrics are being calculated on the wrong date... should be [momentum data][past month]
 	  - fix mom
 	  	- added 21 days to first index in range (otherwise you get an index out of bounds)
 	  	- also made sure mom metric was being calculated starting the day before the first day of current month
 	  - fix vol
 	  	 - ok
 	  - fix momvol
 	  	 - ok
 - 1/25/2013: finished mom, vol, and momvol algs. what's next?
 	- small batching says: make it a webapp right now
 		- django? probably a better idea than ror
