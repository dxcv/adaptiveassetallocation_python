 - the momentum + risk parity seems too good to be true...
 	 - although... i am selecting by momentum FIRST. so high flying etfs like EEM will be selected. then i'm toning down my exposure to them based on volatility...
 	 	- so during 2007, when equities were faltering, i stopped selecting them. even before that though, i was reducing my exposure due to volatility
 	 - should i step through it, make sure there isn't any lookahead bias? esp. during times of supposed economic volatility...
 	 - what about trying to replicate the returns, by building it off mom_backtest (instead of vol_backtest)
 	 	- honestly, since i will just be copy pasting code, this should be exactly the same...
 	 - OH SHIT
